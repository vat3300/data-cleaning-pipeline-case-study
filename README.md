# Data Cleaning Pipeline – Case Study

## Overview
This case study demonstrates a structured approach to cleaning raw operational data and transforming it into analytics-ready datasets that can be reliably used for reporting and dashboards.

## Problem Context
In real-world business environments, data often comes from multiple operational systems and contains missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect mappings. Without a proper cleaning pipeline, such data leads to unreliable reporting and poor decision-making.

## Key Data Challenges
- Missing and null values across critical fields  
- Duplicate and inconsistent records  
- Inconsistent date and text formats  
- Incorrect or incomplete reference mappings  
- Lack of validation and quality checks  

## Cleaning Approach
The data cleaning pipeline follows a systematic, step-by-step process:
1. Ingest raw operational data from source systems  
2. Standardize formats (dates, text, categories)  
3. Handle missing, invalid, and outlier values  
4. Apply de-duplication logic  
5. Perform data validation and quality checks  
6. Generate clean, analytics-ready output datasets  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas)  
- SQL  
- Power BI (for downstream reporting)

## Outcome
The final cleaned dataset can be directly used to build reliable dashboards and reports, improving data accuracy, consistency, and operational visibility for business teams.
## Notes
This repository focuses on demonstrating the thought process and structure behind a data cleaning pipeline. Code and sample datasets will be added incrementally.
